### Sample Application using the React UI framework

This is a sample application created using ReactJS framework.
The application includes both the front end and the back end for a commenting system.
I have created this application by following the steps given on React's website.

### JS libraries/frameworks/tooling used
1. Express - for handling REST API requests
2. Gulp, Browserify, watchify for build management.
3. Babelify for converting from ES6 to ES5
4. ReactJS as the UI library at the front end for a very simple commenting system.

### TODO:
1. Use Redux - a library which will enable to use the UI development paradigm recommended by Facebook.


### Running the application:
1. Git clone this repo.
2. Make sure you have Node.js version of atleast 4.0
3. Run npm install in the project root directory.
4. Open a shell in the root directory and issue the command `npm start`
